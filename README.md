# FOIAFest Hackathon 2019

## RSVP!

[Make sure to RSVP on Eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/foiafest-hackathon-2019-tickets-75730783813)! Participation is free but registering makes sure we'll have enough food and drink.

## Goals

Come together with students, hackers, educators, and government officials to unlock important stories about water in the United States and abroad — and help find solutions to some of society's most pressing health emergencies.

This free hackathon, sponsored by Grand Valley State University and Big Data Ignite, will bring together interdisciplinary groups to analyze and probe a variety of key data sets proactively posted by government or obtained through Freedom of Information requests.

Over the course of the day, you'll get to work with a group to help pull out trends, highlight challenges, and prototype better ways to get the word out to affected communities about how critical it is that safe, affordable water is available.

Two prizes — one for an internationally-focused project and one for a U.S.-centric project — will be awarded.
